4 WHICH PURPOSES AND PROCESSING BASIS DO WE HAVE WHEN WE PROCESS YOUR PERSONAL DATA?
We process your personal data for the following purposes and based on the following grounds for processing:

In order for us to be able to offer and provide services to you through the VOYAH app, we process contact information such as name, address, telephone number etc. about you, in addition to information about ordering products and services, including payment information. Our processing basis for processing your personal data for this purpose is that the processing is necessary to fulfill an agreement between you as a customer and us as a provider of a service;

You can change the settings in the app at any time or contact us to adjust the scope of your consent. You can also delete your user account if you want us to stop collecting and processing your personal data. However, we emphasize that without your consent there may be several functions in the app that you cannot access.

If we use suppliers who process personal data on our behalf, we will always ensure that we enter into data processing agreements that safeguard privacy. If necessary, we will be able to share your personal data with the following parties:
• Parties who contribute to booking and reserving cars in the app, carrying out such purchases and booking additional services. With these we share information such as ID card, passport or other valid identification, telephone number, address and payment information.
