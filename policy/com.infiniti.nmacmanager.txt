 How does INFINITI collect Usage Data? 
 
Usage data may be collected by INFINITI or its third-party providers automatically through “cookies,” log files and other tracking tools and technology embedded within our Platforms. This information may be collected over time and across devices. INFINITI uses this information to administer and improve its Platforms and to improve the services provided to you. 
 
A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's device containing information about the user. If a user rejects or deletes the cookie, use of our websites may be adversely impacted, and functionality may be unavailable or limited in some areas of our websites. Cookies also enable us to track and aggregate data about the way you navigate our Platforms in some cases. By doing this, we can better target the interests of our users and enhance their experience on our Platforms. 
 
INFINITI or our service providers or other third parties may use web logs or pixel tags, and/or other tracking technologies (sometimes referred to as “smart cookies”) on your computer or other device. Smart cookies are images embedded in a webpage or e-mail for the purpose of measuring and analyzing usage and activity. Our websites, or third-party service providers acting on our behalf, may use smart cookies to help us analyze usage and improve our functionality. Some cookies and other technologies may serve to recall Personal Data previously provided by a user. 
 
INFINITI may not respond to “do not track” beacons, tags or other such signals including browser-based prompts or controls. You may also receive tracking mechanisms from other parties prior to visiting our websites that will continue to track your activity while on our websites. Such data would be subject to the privacy policy of the other party from whom you received the mechanism. We do not control or receive data from such mechanisms. 
 
INFINITI advertising at other non-INFINITI sites may be serviced by INFINITI service providers, who may use cookies to collect information about your visits to those sites. Information collected may include the pages visited, date and time, browser information and/or IP address. This information is gathered in order to help us customize and target our advertising to the needs and interests of our customers.
