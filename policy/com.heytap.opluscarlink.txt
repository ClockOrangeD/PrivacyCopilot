CarLinkUnit Introduction
Overview
CarLink service is a service for in-car devices on the Android platform, providing functions such as Bluetooth car keys and car remote control.

Scenario Introduction
To better understand the functions provided by the CarLink service, let's introduce some application scenarios, including Bluetooth car key functionality and car remote control functionality.

Bluetooth Car Key Functionality
This function allows car manufacturers to enable Bluetooth car key unlocking functionality through the SDK. After the user binds their vehicle by adding the "Bluetooth car key" card in the "OPPO Wallet" app, when the user approaches the bound vehicle with their mobile phone, the CarLink service can wake up the corresponding car manufacturer's app and then use the car manufacturer's app to unlock the vehicle.

Car Remote Control Functionality
Car manufacturers can enable car remote control functionality by integrating the SDK or connecting to the cloud service. After the user binds their vehicle in "Minus One Screen - Breeno Quick Look", a vehicle card will be generated in "Minus One Screen - Breeno Quick Look". Through the quick operations on the card, users can remotely control certain functions of the vehicle, such as doors, windows, air conditioning, horn and vehicle location. The specific vehicle control functions depend on the features provided by the car manufacturer.
